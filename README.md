# Waldo Backend PHP Developer Test

In Total the test has taken me 10 hours, 8 of which I kept making school boy errors, be it typos or
not reading the readme correctly.

After taking a long break and coming back to the issue to fix the BrokenSorter (now deleted) from the beginning. It has taken me 2 hours to complete, including installing mongodb.

**Note:** I have tackled this problem as if I encountered it in real life. Using mongodb for a large json dataset and sorting the data, which helps take the load off of PHP, as mush as PHP is great and a lot faster with PHP 7 then PHP 5, it still needs a helping hand... much like us :')
